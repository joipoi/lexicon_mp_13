I used the LiveCurrency.cs file to help with currency exchange.
To get it working I had to add CurrencyObj class.
I also had to change in the Convert method from "ExchangeRateFromEUR" to "Rate"

I started with having a Phone and Computer class that inherited from Asset, but I did
not like it so I changed.
